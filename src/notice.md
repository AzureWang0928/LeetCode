1. overflow for int type
2. l1 = l1==null?l1:l1.next;
3. return result.next;
###### 26

1. To get the length of the array, we use array.length, while for string, we use `str.length()`

1. Use a count var to store the length

###### 28

1. Judge the boundary conditions when the length of needle is 0.
2. `subString()` method is the highlights of this problem.


###### 35

1. Time complexity is O(logn) by using binary search

##### 53

1. Dynamic Programming is the most important part of this problems.
2. Divide and Conquer is the efficient way to improve the complexity from o(n) to o(logn)

###### 389

1. Use ASCII to solve the problem
